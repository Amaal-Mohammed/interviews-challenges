<strong>TL;DR,</strong> This challenge expects you to write some e2e tests to accomplish required functionality. You can use any language, assertion framework, etc. We prefer Selenium running on Chrome.
The challenge has two parts:

## Evaluation criteria:

In addition to the functionality, we will also evaluate the code style, scenarios, test structure, assertions, Git messages, code linting, and ease of setup.

## Tests:

### First Part:
- Build an automated test for the website registration make sure to check validations process.

### Second Part:
- Test Authors endpoints make sure to check the parameters validation and responses.

## Workflow:

- First, create user scenarios for each test
- Write code to test them
- Put scenarios in the repo (It does not matter how you store them, just mention in README where to look for scenarios)

## How to submit?

Clone this repo and create pull request once you feel the code is ready.
