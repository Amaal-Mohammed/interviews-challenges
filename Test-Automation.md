<strong>TL;DR,</strong> This challenge expects you to write some e2e tests to accomplish required functionality. You can use any JavaScript testing framework, with any assertation and coverage you like while we prefer Jest or Cypress.

The challenge has two parts:

## Evaluation criteria:

In addition to the functionality, we will also evaluate the code style, scenarios, test structure, assertions, Git messages, code linting, and ease of setup.

## Tests:

### UI Test:
- Build an automated test for the website registration; make sure to test the field validation.

### API Test:
- Test the Authors endpoints make sure to test the parameter validation and responses.

## Workflow:

- First, create user scenarios for each test
- Write code to test them
- Put scenarios in the repo (It does not matter how you store them, just mention in README where to look for scenarios)

## How to submit?

Clone this repo and create a pull request once you feel the code is ready.
