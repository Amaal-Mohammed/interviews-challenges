# Software Test Developer (Selenium)

<strong>TL;DR,</strong> This challenge expects you to write some e2e tests to accomplish required functionality.  
You can use any language, assertion framework, etc..
It should be based on Selenium and we prefer running on Chrome  

## Evaluation criteria:

In addition to the functionality, we will also evaluate the code style, scenarios, test structure, assertions, Git messages, code linting, and ease of setup.

## Tests:

- Test registration to app.knawat.com
- Complete your profile by loggining in app.knawat.com
- Create 2 web stores (one with CSV, one with Shopify)
- Archive CSV store

## Workflow:

- First create user scenarios for each test
- Write code to test them
- Put scenarios in repo (It does not matter how you store them, just mention in README where to look for scneraios)

## How to submit?

Clone this repo and create pull request once you feel code is ready.
